            <h2>EdX</h2>
            <p>EdX is a Harvard run online class dedicated to teaching people to code. During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, I looked to imrpove my programming abilities so I signed up for the class EdX CS50: Game Development.</p>
            <p>In this class, we were taught to create games using the lua programming language and the Love2d framework. We were also taught techniques on how to create more realistic game while also lowering the amount of resources used.</p>
